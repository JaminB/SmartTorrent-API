                "@Iznogoud9   It sounds more than acceptable to me friend. The very fact that with one download I can now finally watch these (I am an old fan of the books but never felt compelled to watch the series until I found your upload) without having to undertake an epic quest to find all the single episodes makes up for any flaws that might have existed in my personal opinion. Thank you very much.",
