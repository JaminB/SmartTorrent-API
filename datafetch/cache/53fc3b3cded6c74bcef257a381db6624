Took me a couple hours to get all of these put together. <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"/confirm/url/aHR0cDovL215cGNzZXJ2aWNlcy51cy9kb2NzL0dvVF9TdWJzLjd6/\" class=\"ajaxLink\">http://mypcservices.us/docs/GoT_Subs.7z</a> Use 7zip to open and then just paste into each season folder, use PotPlayer or VLC and it should pick up on these as the first subtitle option<br />\r",
