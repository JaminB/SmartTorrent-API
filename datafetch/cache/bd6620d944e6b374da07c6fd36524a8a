                "Guys there IS a way around Cinevia. There are actually 2 ways. One only works sometimes, but is a complete fix, and the second way always works but you have to do it a few times during the movie. The first way is to change the name of the file, to anything but the name of the movie it is. I know weird, but it DOES work sometimes! I swear! I have personally done it! The second solution, kinda sucks but it ALWAYS works. Now for a movie where there are dozens of other good copies, I would say just download a different torrent. But-for those movies that are till in theater or there are limited torrents, here is what you do: once the sound cuts out and you get the Cinevia pop up, press circle and back out of the movie all the way to the main to PS3 menu (don't worry, your movie will restart right where it left off when you come back to it). Go to the time and date settings, and select the option to manually set the time/date. Change the YEAR, one year ahead ie. if its 4/6/14, make it 4/6/15. Make sure you click \"X\" so it sets the new date, then play your movie. You will need to do this about every 25-30mins, which usually menas about 3x per movie, which does kinda suck. BUT-it does work, and once you have done it once, the spot in the settings will save too, so you literally just press X to pause, then circle however many times depending to get to menu, then when you press X in the settings it will have stayed right on the time/date section so you just press X into that again, click the year, X again, then a couple more Xs into the movie. It literally takes a few seconds. It is far from a perfect solution, but for those movies where you cannot find a Cinevia-free copy, it does the trick =)",

Line audio is decent, cam quality is pretty crisp, does spazz out in a few places with some RGB color bleed, but no big deal. For a movie thats still in cinemas, I highly rate this copy, coulda fooled me into believing it was a DVDrip. I usually dl'd x264 Dolby Digital Blu Rays with bitrates of at least 4mb AVC MKV codec. I would grab this again just to prove a point, so spend the bandwidth, you might be surprised.",

Just a few notes on YIFI....yes the audios always leave something needful.  Cured problem with sound bar which raises volume without losing quality.  One can cercumvent the cinevia problem by putting the movie on a Flash Drive and playing through a USB Port.  YIFI is the among the best in the business and I personally want to say thankyou for your work.  However, Please Note YIFY.....if you know that your upload is in fact protected by cinevia....it would be prudent to warn your devotees.  And yes it would be nice to see your posts from time to time reguard to some specific issues.  Unfortunately, there are some people one cannot help.  With all that being said....again thankyou.
