["Hi it's not an aggressive post, I'd just like to understand, and maybe I'm being na\xc3\xafve, but how is it possible to upload an album before its release date? You posted this one on March 16, but the release date was programmed to be March 18, today, where did you find the album before?", 'Umm it was leaked online, I just searched for it.  Early releases will usually find their way to P2P sites in no time.']
