I give you your point that any source can only be as credible as the audience allows, but please keep in mind the ease of changes across certain mediums. A published encyclopedia not only undergoes years of scrutiny and review but once printed can't easily be changed. This means that factual articles stay just that. A website that is freely editable by the community can easily change from minute to minute and if you use it as one of your cited works then by the time someone gets back to it then who knows what will be on the page. I'm not saying I don't use wikipedia, on the contrary I usually go there first for my information on most things. However, I wouldn't defend it as this grand source of information. For the same reason it's so good that's what makes it so unreliable, it can be changed by the community. All it takes is one person to mess things up.<br />",

I frequently download a movie that vlc won\u2019t play \u2026 I usually get the audio with a slow, slow slide show effect  for video made up of random screen shots.  I\u2019ve found if I use \u201cAny Video Converter\u201d to convert  to some other format (which I know little about) it will play.  I downloaded this movie to experiment with a vlc scheme I read about to play as an anaglyph 3d, but it wouldn\u2019t play at all until I converted to an mp4 w/html 5.  Then, it played with a side by side, but sometimes reverted to the slideshow effect for a while and was sometimes very pixilated.  By the way, the anaglyph stuff didn\u2019t work\uf04c  I tried the cross eyed method, but the 3d effect was minimal.  I tried kmplayer for its 3d support and got no video and the audio disintegrated into something like Morse code.  On the converted html 5 I get audio and no video, but interestingly, a mouse over on the progress bar shows thumbnails of random screen shots.  I don\u2019t know where resources exist to figure out the \u201ccorrupted\u201d downloads, or a workable way to create anaglyphs \u2026 can anyone help me?  This is not exactly a help forum \u2026 you can email me w/same name at yahoo.",
