Worth downloading in my opinion. Took me 26hours due to the slow monopoly internet service on the island but it was worth it. Thanks uploader and KAT. Now even someone like me in a small island in the South Pacific can watch my favourite DC comics action hero whenever. Thanks heaps mate. ",

Some people rate the quality according to how good it looks for its \"type\" (as in, this is outstanding for a \"cam\"), and some people rate the quality according to the ideal (as in this \"cam\" file is awful compared to 1080p blu-ray). I vote for the latter standard. Who cares if it looks good for a cam? Who wants to watch that crap? By the way, I haven't downloaded this file because it sounds like it might be a high-quality cam, which is like an oxymoron if memory serves correctly. ",

The reason why Bane's voice is louder than every other character's is because instead of his voice coming out just the center channel like most voices it plays out of the whole front (FL C FR Channels) that's how it soundd in theaters and if played on stereo like alot of people on here play there files it just sounds bad and this movie is incredibly loud during action scenes (also how it was in theaters) and as far as the video the aspect ratio changes like it does on the bluray from 2.35:1 to IMAX at certain parts in the movie.
