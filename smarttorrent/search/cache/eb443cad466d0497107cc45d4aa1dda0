You will see a file that has the daeamon tools logo next to it called an ISO file. Drag that file into the open daemon tools window and drop it in. Once its in daemon tools right click it and hit mount. Once you do this your computer thinks the install cd is in your disk reader. Now just install the game according to the instructions and before you run the game, open the original download file for the game again, and look for a folder called \"crack\", if there isnt one, right click the ISO file and hit open and in there should be the crack files. Drag these files and drop them in to the games install directory, usually C:Program Files(x86)/EA Games/Name of game(whatever it is). It will ask you if you want to over write the files that are the same, hit yes to all, this is how you know you placed them in the right place, they should overwrite the original files.

It was a major let down to watch the entire movie then not see any credits.

V: 10 is BluRay FULL rip quality, 0 compression. Usually 16+ Gigs. A: 10 is full surround 5/6 channel sound. This is stereo, and 1920x800 resolution. By all means, I still download YIFY 1080p quality. But this is Lord of the Rings.. Released a DECADE ago. If your 1080 is not 1080... You should remove your release. People don't download 1080 for sub-1080 quality at this point in a franchise movie. Just saying. Respect the rating system. Most of us aren't running CRTs anymore ;) ",
